Changelog:
- THE ANIMATION UPDATE - I added a lot of little animations throughout the UI to make everything feel a little smoother, hopefully I didn't overdo it.
- The main page now has integration for micro trailers which will need to be downloaded or generated from the ExtraMetaDataLoader addon.
   - The width change when the trailer loads is designed around square covers, this can easily be changed in the ListGameItemStyle xaml located in the DerivedStyles folder. Search for !--FOCUS WIDTH in that file and read the note there to modify to your liking.
- The main page will also now show logos, also from ExtraMetaDataLoader if available when the game is in focus for a short period of time.
